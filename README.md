# Data-Analysis-BITCOIN Dataset 

This project was done in the period of a Data science internship program at the WIDHYA internship organization. 

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. We are considering the dataset involving the details of BITCOIN price variation details.

## Project Synopsis

>> This repo contains Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization of BITCOIN Dataset taken from the  [Click here](https://widhya.org/).

## Data Cleaning

After collecting the data, checked for the null and duplicate values present in the dataset to provide better accuracy of the result by removing it. Changes I made and what all variables & scripts I wrote:

    * Filled not available values using the Median.
    * Converted Dataset into modeling purpose to predict the price of BITCOIN in future. 
   
-------------------------------
## EDA {Exploratory Data Analysis}

* All the imported distributions from the data cleaning data-set, I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various numerical and categorical variables.
* Using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**, categorized and crafted a beautiful data visualisation charts & plots
* Below are a few highlights from the *Pivot tables, Barplots & HeatMaps*.
